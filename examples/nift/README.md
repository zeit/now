# Nift Example

This directory is a brief example of a [Nift](https://nift.cc) site that can be deployed with Vercel and zero configuration.

## Deploy Your Own

Deploy your own Nift project with Vercel.

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/import/project?template=https://github.com/zeit/now/tree/master/examples/nift)

### How We Created This Example

To get started with Nift on Vercel, you can fork or import template [websites](https://nift.dev/resources/templates.html) and [blogs](https://nift.dev/resources/blog_templates.html) then clone using:

```shell
$ nift clone clone-url
```

### Building Your Website

Once you have made changes inside the `content` and `template` directories you can build your website with either `nift build-updated` (incremental build) or `nift build-all` (full build)

### Deploying From Your Terminal

Once happy with the changes, you can deploy (build, commit and push) your websites with just a single command:

```shell
$ nift bcp "commit message"
```

A dark, slick, modern, responsive, adjective-drenched design built around an extremely
dynamic landing page (scroll that mofo!). Inspired by Big Picture, another design
of mine with a similarish feel/flow, only this time I took it waaaaaay further and
actually made it multipurpose (versus copping out and making it a one pager like I
did last time ;) Includes multiple pages, a bunch of pre-styled elements, and all
its Sass sources.
